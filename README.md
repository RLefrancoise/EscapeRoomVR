# EscapeRoomVR
An Escape Room in VR on Unity, for Google Cardboard. It is a 1 year old project, when I was still not very at ease with Unity, but it works fine and is good enough in my opinion.

You can play also in editor:

- *Alt*: Rotate the head
- *Left click*: select an object gazed by the reticle
